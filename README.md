# Curlew release build

This is the release build for my custom blogging platform, Curlew.

This is the version of Curlew that I work on when I want to add new features and fix bugs.

More information and the full commit history for this project can be found on my other repository, curlew-blogging-platform.

I'm not sure this was the most efficient way to go about this project (the other (original) repository now contains the code for a website for Curlew), but I'm still learning.
